        "\n",
        "* **Reduced Coding Time**: Functions reduce coding time by allowing you to write a\n",
        "routine once and call it multiple times, rather than coding the same routine multiple times.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Reduced Debugging Time**: Functions also reduce debugging time by allowing you to make changes in one place, rather than having to make changes in multiple places.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Enhanced Readability**: Functions enhance the readability of a program by breaking the code into smaller, organized, and reusable pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Avoid Duplication**: Functions help avoid duplication of effort and code in programs by allowing you to reuse the same code multiple times."

Each function has its own local scope, which contains all the names defined within the function. These names are only accessible within the function. When a function is called, a new local scope is created for that call. This means that if a function is called multiple times, each call will have its own local scope."

This can be done by using try-except blocks in your code to catch and handle exceptions that may be raised. By handling exceptions, you can provide an alternative flow of execution to avoid crashing your program unexpectedly."

If an exception is raised, the execution of the try clause is stopped and control is passed to the except clause. The except clause defines a block of code that will be executed if an exception is raised within the try clause. This code can handle the exception, for example by logging it or displaying an error message."
