        "**1**. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy( ) and shutil.copytree( )?\n",
        "**Answer**: The shutil module in Python provides many functions for high-level operations on files and collections of files. The shutil.copy( ) function is used to copy a single file from the source to the destination, while the shutil.copytree( ) function is used to recursively copy an entire directory tree rooted at the source to the destination directory. The destination directory, named by dst, must not already exist as it will be created during copying."

        "\n",
        "**Answer**: The shutil.rmtree() function can be used to delete a directory and all its contents1. However, this function permanently deletes the files and directories, and the operation cannot be undone if there were any accidental deletions performed. The send2trash.send2trash() function sends the specified file or directory to the Trash or Recycle Bin instead of permanently deleting it. This allows you to recover the deleted files or directories if necessary by restoring them from the Trash or Recycle Bin. The main difference between the delete functions in the shutil and send2trash modules is that shutil.rmtree() permanently deletes files and directories, while send2trash.send2trash() sends them to the Trash or Recycle Bin where they can be recovered if needed."
