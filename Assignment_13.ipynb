        "\n",
        "1. **Operations on data**: Excel can perform operations on the data, while CSV files canâ€™t.\n",
        "2. **Formatting**: Excel not only stores data but can also do operations on the data. It contains formatting, formulas, macros, etc. A CSV file is just a text file, it stores data but does not contain formatting.\n",
        "3. **Portability**: The main advantage of Excel over CSV format is its greater portability (CSV format is supported on all Xpress platforms) and the possibility to combine the csv driver freely it with other drivers, such as shmem or rmt that are not compatible with the other spreadsheet drivers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, Excel spreadsheets are more powerful than CSV spreadsheets in terms of operations on data, formatting and portability."
