        "\n",
        "**Answer**: Using logging messages is better than using `print()` statements to display the same message for several reasons. Here are some of the advantages of using logging over `print()` statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: The `logging` module provides a lot of flexibility in terms of where the log messages are sent, how they are formatted, and what information they contain. You can log messages to files, sockets, or any other output stream, and you can configure the logging system to output messages in different formats. With `print()` statements, you have less control over where the messages are sent and how they are formatted.\n",
        "- **Severity levels**: The `logging` module allows you to differentiate between log messages based on their severity level. This means that you can choose to only output log messages that meet a certain severity level, such as `ERROR` or `WARNING`, while ignoring less important messages such as `DEBUG` or `INFO`. With `print()` statements, all messages are treated equally and there is no way to filter them based on their importance.\n",
        "- **Easy to disable**: Logging messages can be easily disabled by changing the logging level or by calling the `logging.disable()` function. This means that you can turn off logging messages when your program is ready for production without having to remove or comment out any `print()` statements.\n",
        "- **Better for libraries**: If you are writing a library that will be used by other developers, it's considered bad practice to use `print()` statements because they can clutter the output of the program that is using your library. With logging, users of your library can choose whether or not they want to see log messages from your library and can configure the logging system accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, using logging messages provides more flexibility, control, and configurability than using `print()` statements."

        "\n",
        "- **Step Over**: The Step Over button is used to execute the current line of code and then pause execution at the next line. If the current line contains a function call, the entire function is executed as a single step, and the debugger does not enter the function. This is useful when you want to skip over a function that you know is working correctly.\n",
