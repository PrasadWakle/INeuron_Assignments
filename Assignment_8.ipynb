        "\n",
        "**Answer**: PyInputPlus is commonly imported with the statement import pyinputplus as pyip to make it easier to use the functions provided by the module. The as pyip part of the statement creates an alias for the pyinputplus module, allowing you to use the shorter name pyip instead of the longer name pyinputplus when calling its functions. This can make your code more concise and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, instead of writing pyinputplus.inputInt(), you can write pyip.inputInt() after importing the module with the statement import pyinputplus as pyip. This is a common practice in Python programming, and many modules are often imported with an alias to make them easier to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s important to note that the alias you choose is up to you, and you can use any name you like. However, it’s a good idea to choose a short and descriptive name that makes it clear what the module does. In this case, pyip is a commonly used alias for PyInputPlus because it’s short and easy to remember."
